Litle XML Documentation repository
----------------------------------
This repository contains Litle & Co.'s XML schema and XML API documentation.

Relationship to our SDK's
-------------------------
Our language specific SDK's all utilize the Litle XML format for processing.  There is a one to one correlation between
the SDK object model and our XML format.  If you are wondering about the validation rules for a specific field, or in
need of more information regarding what to populate in a field our XML guide will provide the information you need.

If you need further support please contact us, we'd love to help.
